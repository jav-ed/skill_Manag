# doc-start

Write docs so an agent can orient itself without being forced to read everything. The docs system is a map: `Project_Manag/Docs/doc_Start.md` gives the agent enough overview to decide what is relevant, and each linker file does the same for its sub-area. The agent navigates the system, it does not consume it. This skill follows the same pattern, applied to its own SKILL.md.

## The principle: navigation-first, not dump-first

An agent works best when it can quickly tell what in its context is relevant to the current task and what is not. Every irrelevant doc loaded competes with the relevant ones and degrades the agent's decisions. So the docs system must give the agent an easy time deciding what to read and what to skip, and what is not loaded must still be findable through good labels. The system must:

1. Give enough orientation upfront, at every level, that the agent understands the area.
2. Inline a summary at the top of `doc_Start.md` and every linker file, so the most-used context comes for free.
3. Route the long tail through clearly-labeled links, so the agent can decide what to load without opening the file.

The load-bearing piece is the labels, not the file split. A flat doc with sharp labels beats a deeply nested doc with murky ones every time.

## Doc system structure

Three tiers, top to leaf:

```

`doc_Start.md` lives at `Project_Manag/Docs/doc_Start.md`, never at the repo root. Topic-area docs live under `Project_Manag/Docs/<Area>/` as siblings of `doc_Start.md`. Each area gets its own `linker_<Area>.md` once it has docs. Sub-areas can have their own linkers, in which case the parent points to the sub-linker, not the sub-linker's leaves. Link paths in `doc_Start.md` are therefore relative to `Project_Manag/Docs/` (e.g. `Architecture/linker_Architecture.md`).

Optional, never required: wherever it helps, for example deep inside a nested folder tree (deep nesting is good, see the `file-tree-optimization` skill), a folder may carry a very short `README.md` that says in a sentence or two what happens here and links to the one place in the main docs (`Project_Manag/Docs/`) that covers it. It never replaces that doc and never repeats its content, so each fact keeps one home.

Repo references are split by ownership. First-party repos use stable shortcut names in prose, with host-scoped full checkout paths recorded in `Project_Manag/Docs/Setup/internal_Repo_Paths.md`. External or third-party reference repos are shallow clones under gitignored `Repos/`, with clone commands recorded in `Project_Manag/Docs/Setup/repos_List.md`. For the full convention, see [Repos convention](References/repos_Convention.md).

`Scratch/` lives at the repo root and is disposable and gitignored. Its four standard folders are `Agent_Tasks/`, `Audit/`, `Design/`, and `Screenshots/`. Every scaffold includes `just scratch-clean`, a manual command that empties Scratch and recreates those four folders. Nothing durable may depend on Scratch files. See [Scratch cleanup](References/scratch_Cleanup.md) for the helper, existing projects, and deletion boundaries.

For **webpage projects only**, `Project_Manag/Docs/Setup/visual_Testing.md` documents how the agent runs visual tests against the project's dev server (playwright commands, dev server check, scratch folder usage). Non-webpage projects do not create this file. For the convention, see [Webpage setup](References/webpage_Setup.md).

When starting a new repo, the required folders (`Architecture`, `Decisions`, `Descr`, `Research`, `Setup`), `Project_Manag/Docs/doc_Start.md`, `Project_Manag/Docs/Setup/internal_Repo_Paths.md`, `Project_Manag/Docs/Setup/repos_List.md`, and `Live_Working/open_Issues.md` need to be present. The user can run `Code/bootstrap.sh` to create the full scaffold, including the four Scratch folders, the cleanup helper and Just recipe, and `Setup/scratch.md`; the agent can also create missing pieces by hand, but should only run the bootstrap script when explicitly asked. Setup never invokes cleanup, and existing Just recipes are retained. `Brand/` and `Investigation/` are added only when the project actually has material in those categories. `visual_Testing.md` is added only on webpage projects. For what each folder is for, see [Folder guidance](References/folder_Guidance.md).

## Writing rules (common case)

These are the rules used in nearly every doc-start task. The full ruleset including style conventions is in [Writing rules](References/writing_Rules.md).

- `doc_Start.md` and every linker file open with a summary of the area before the link list. They are not pure indexes.
- Every link uses `[Short label](path.md): description rich enough for the reader to decide without clicking`. Use a colon, never an em-dash.
- Link descriptions are not limited to one line. One line when one line covers it, five lines when the topic genuinely needs five. Clarity for navigation, not brevity.
- When a sub-folder has its own linker, the parent links to that sub-linker, not its leaves. The parent points to the door, the sub-linker handles the room.
- Do not dump every doc into `doc_Start.md`. Include only what helps the reader decide where to go next.
- Do not impose a reading order ("start here first") unless the user explicitly asks for one.

## File and folder naming

`.md` files use lowercase first letter (`writing_Rules.md`, `linker_Architecture.md`). Folders use uppercase first letter (`Architecture/`, `Project_Manag/`). For the full naming convention, see the `coding` skill.
